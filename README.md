Reliance Stock Analysis using LSTM

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes Reliance Industries' stock price trends using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a deep learning model for time-series forecasting. It helps predict future stock prices based on historical data.


---

ðŸ”¹ Features & Methodology

âœ” Data Collection: Collected historical stock price data of Reliance Industries.

âœ” Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data using Pandas & NumPy.

âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

âœ” Model Training: Used LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network) for stock price prediction.

âœ” Evaluation: Compared model predictions with actual stock prices.

ðŸ”¹ Results & Insights

ðŸ“ˆ The LSTM model effectively predicts Reliance stock prices, capturing long-term trends.
ðŸ“‰ However, stock prices depend on market conditions, so predictions should be used cautiously.
